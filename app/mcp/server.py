"""
Calseta MCP Server — Model Context Protocol adapter.

Thin adapter over the REST API's service layer. Exposes security data as
MCP resources and actions as MCP tools so any MCP-compatible client (Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) can access Calseta without custom API
client code.

This module creates the ``FastMCP`` server instance with API key
authentication. Resources and tools are registered in Wave 7 chunks 7.2–7.5.
