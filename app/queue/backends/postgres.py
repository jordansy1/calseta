"""
ProcrastinateBackend — procrastinate + PostgreSQL task queue.

This is the default and recommended backend. Tasks are stored durably in
PostgreSQL using procrastinate's `procrastinate_jobs` table, which is
created by Alembic migration (procrastinate ships its own schema).

Driver note:
    procrastinate v3 removed AsyncpgConnector. It now uses PsycopgConnector
    (psycopg3 / psycopg_pool). Both `asyncpg` (for SQLAlchemy) and `psycopg`
    (for procrastinate) connect to the same PostgreSQL instance. This is
    intentional — they are independent driver choices for each library.

    DATABASE_URL is in SQLAlchemy format: postgresql+asyncpg://...
    PsycopgConnector expects standard libpq DSN: postgresql://...
    The `+asyncpg` specifier is stripped at construction time.

Enqueue performance:
    Each enqueue() call opens a fresh pool and closes it. For high-volume
    deployments, wire open_async() into FastAPI lifespan to reuse the pool.
    Deferred to Wave 5+ since enqueueing isn't called in Wave 1.

SIGTERM handling:
    procrastinate's run_worker_async() handles SIGTERM natively — it
    finishes the current job, then exits cleanly.
