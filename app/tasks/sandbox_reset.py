"""
Sandbox reset — wipe transient data, delete user-created config, re-seed fixtures.

Designed to run as a periodic procrastinate task (daily at midnight UTC).
Can also be called directly for manual resets.

Reset phases:
  1. Delete transient/audit data (all rows — these are always re-creatable)
  2. Delete all alerts + indicators (re-seeded in phase 4)
  3. Delete user-created config only (is_system=FALSE)
  4. Re-seed sandbox fixtures
